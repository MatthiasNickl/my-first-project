## Introduction

This is a report on the height density of males and females.

We are going to use the following libraries:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
```

And we use the following data sets:

```{r}
data(heights)
```

We generate the plot with the following code:

```{r density-plot}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(height, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

inline equation: $$sd = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sigma^2 + \tau^2}}$$
